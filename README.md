ðŸŒŸ Project Highlight: Analyzing India's Economic Growth (2000-2015) ðŸŒŸ

I'm excited to share a project I recently completed on India's economic growth from 2000 to 2015. With the help of AI (about 70% of the work), I created two detailed dashboards using Microsoft Power BI that visualize various economic indicators, including GDP and GNI growth.

ðŸ“Š Dashboards Included:

India GDP and GNI Growth_page-0001: This dashboard presents the year-over-year growth of GDP and GNI, per capita income trends, and a comprehensive economic indicator table.
India GDP and GNI Growth_page-0002: This dashboard provides an overview of economic indicators, including CAGR comparison, year-over-year growth rates, and the GDP to GNI ratio trend.
This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply data analysis and visualization skills to real-world data, enhancing my understanding of economic trends and patterns.
